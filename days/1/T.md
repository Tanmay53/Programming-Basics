# Object Oriented Programming

## Objects

Let's check out what is the meaning of Object in Hindi.
It is "VASTU".

Objects can be designed to model real-world things in software.
Objects group together details.

Apne aas paas dekho, kitni vastuen hai. Ab ham jab inke baare mein software mein likhenge to jis chheez ka istemal karenge use Object kahenge.

Vastu(Object) hame kai saari jankariyon ko sanjohne mein madad karti hai.

Chalo kuch objects describe karte hai:

1. Ghar
    1. address
    2. color
    3. no of floors
    4. area
    5. no of rooms
2. Cycle
    1. sopporter wheel hai ki nahi
    2. shock absorber hai ki nahi
    3. max speed
    4. tyre type
    5. carrier hai ki nahi
    6. seat height
    7. tyre mein hawa kitne pressure tak padti hai
    8. lock

You see ham ek shabd keh ke kisi cheez ke baare mein kai baten keh sakte hai.
Agar mai swimming pool bolun to, hum sabke man mein ek rectangular blue color ke bottom wala pool aa jayega.
Kuch aise hi functionality for computer mein lane ke liye ham Objects ka istemal karte hai.

## Abstraction

Abstraction means showing only whatâ€™s relevant and useful for the person using it.
By hiding all the inner workings of a given object with abstraction, we are able to reduce their apparent complexity.

Chalo ek vastu lete hai,

Bike:

1. Kya aap kabhi bike pe baithe hai?
2. Kya aapko bata hai bike ka engine kaise kaam karta hai?
3. Kya bike chalane ya uspe baithne ke liye aapko pata hona chanhiye ki bike ka engine kaise kaam karta hai?

Samosa:

1. Kya aapko pata hai ki paas wali dukan mein samosa kitne ka milta hai?
2. Kya aapko pata hai samose ko banane ke liye tel kitne temperature pe hona chahiye?
3. Kya aap ye jaane bina samose ko kha sakte hai?

Objects ya Vastu bhi kuch isi prakar hame utni jankari dete hai jitni hame chahiye, bake ki jankari ujagar nahi karte hai.

Isko ham Abastraction kehte hai, yani Sanshep ya samahne aur istemal karne mein Aasan karna.

## Class

A plan or blueprint for an object is called a class.

A class defines the attributes (a description), the methods (what it does), and the access level (who can use it) for an object.

## Instantiation

To create an object, you have to instantiate it. An instantiated object is called an instance of a class.

Objects from the same class can differ in the details if they have different values for their attributes. They still have to follow the class plan, though!

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling together of attributes, methods, and access control in order to protect an object.

## Objects in Objects

Objects can have attributes that are objects. These objects also have their own independent blueprint (class), attributes, behaviors, and access.

Objects communicate with one another by sending messages.

Associating objects with other objects allows you to more easily adapt and make changes to your system.
