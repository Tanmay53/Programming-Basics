# Object Oriented Programming

## Objects

Let's check out what is the meaning of Object in Hindi.
It is "VASTU".

Objects can be designed to model real-world things in software.
Objects group together details.

Apne aas paas dekho, kitni vastuen hai. Ab ham jab inke baare mein software mein likhenge to jis chheez ka istemal karenge use Object kahenge.

Vastu(Object) hame kai saari jankariyon ko ikattha karne mein madad karti hai.

## Abstraction

Abstraction means showing only whatâ€™s relevant and useful for the person using it.
By hiding all the inner workings of a given object with abstraction, we are able to reduce their apparent complexity.

## Class

A plan or blueprint for an object is called a class.

A class defines the attributes (a description), the methods (what it does), and the access level (who can use it) for an object.

## Instantiation

To create an object, you have to instantiate it. An instantiated object is called an instance of a class.

Objects from the same class can differ in the details if they have different values for their attributes. They still have to follow the class plan, though!

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling together of attributes, methods, and access control in order to protect an object.

## Objects in Objects

Objects can have attributes that are objects. These objects also have their own independent blueprint (class), attributes, behaviors, and access.

Objects communicate with one another by sending messages.

Associating objects with other objects allows you to more easily adapt and make changes to your system.
