# Logic and Elements of Programming

## Discover how computers solve problems

Computers can solve problems by performing billions of operations per second.

A programmer’s job is to find solutions. They do this by breaking down problems into easy-to-follow steps for a computer.

Programming languages allow people to communicate with computers.

Computers are literal and do exactly what you tell them to.

## Work with sequences

A logic flow is the order in which steps are completed in a program.

Steps are completed sequentially, not simultaneously.

Some steps are independent, which means they can be completed in any order.

## Work with states and logical operators

Computers use logical operations to solve problems.

Boolean values can be either true or false.

Other values are null or empty.

Key logical operators are NOT, AND, OR.

## Follow a sequence with conditions

Use if/else statements for conditions.

You can compare elements using greater than, less than, and equal to.

## Iterate your instructions by working with loops

While loops are used when you know the end state you want, but not the number of iterations.

For loops are used when you know the exact number of iterations you need.

An infinite loop is a while loop that gets stuck because it doesn’t have an end condition.
