# Functions and Messages

## Understand how functions work

Coding is fun but you should not duplicate time and effort: use functions for repetitive tasks.

Functions contain a series of instructions you can use again and again.

Functions have names.

When you need a function, you can call it by name.

## Use functions

A black box performs something useful without needing to how it does what it does.

We use black box functions regularly in real life and in programming.

## Write clean functions

Writing clean functions is critical for making sure they work well.

Good function writing takes 4 basic steps:

Choose a goal and name the function accordingly

Define the end result

Define what the function requires as input

Implement the logic

## Define and send messages with functions

Functions can receive messages through parameters.

Functions can send messages through return values.
