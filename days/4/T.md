# Data Storage

Variables are containers where we store data.

Variables are stored in specific locations in computer memory.

Variables have different types.

Variables have names.

## Understand primitive data types

All computers understand the fundamental primitive data types.

Boolean can be only true or false.

String contains a series of alphanumeric characters.

Number is used in arithmetic.

Null is the presence of nothing.

## Recognize the array data type

An array is a container for other objects.

The array contains a fixed number of buckets that you specify when it is created.

Array buckets are accessed using zero-based counting.

Array processing is very fast.

## Discover the list data type

List is an ordered container of objects.

List size is dynamic and can become bigger or smaller according to your needs.

## Explore the dictionary data type

The map or dictionary data type stores rows of key/value pairs.

Rows can be added/removed for any key you wish.

Size is dynamic, and can shrink/grow in real time.
